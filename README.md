# 4x4-Break-In-Machine-v2
Improved iteration of 4x4 break in machine design. Increased motor longevity, along with several quality of life improvements.


This is an improved version of my original break in machine design. Numerous quality of life improvements have been added, and an updated piston plate design has resulted in greater longevity of motors.
Not much more to it, just did this for fun and will probably continue to update the design very slowly.

Off centre functionality has been added. Haven't done much testing, but it works with Cherry switches.

Bill of Material:

Printed

- Machine Housing

- 2 x Piston Plate

- 2 x Rod Cap

- 2 x Switch plate

Purchased

- 2 x HK0306 Roller Bearing (alternatively can use the provided stl file with appropriate horizontal size compensation for printer)

- 1:48 Dual Axis Geared TT DC Motor (alternatively 1:90 metal gearbox for slower and louder, but more reliable performance)

- Some way to power dc motor. Benchtop PSU's works, likewise do 2 core usb cables with the leads soldered to the motor. Power in = brrrr.
